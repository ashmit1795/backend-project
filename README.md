# Playtube - A Video Hosting Platform Backend

Playtube is a fully-featured backend project that replicates the core functionalities of a video hosting platform, similar to YouTube. Built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose, Playtube provides a robust foundation for managing users, videos, likes, comments, and more. This project follows industry-standard practices, such as JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and support for both access and refresh tokens.


## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup using JWT and bcrypt.
- **Video Management:** Users can upload, view, and manage their videos, including the ability to upload thumbnails.
- **Social Interactions:** Users can like, dislike, comment on videos, reply to comments, and subscribe or unsubscribe from channels.
- **Community Posts:** Users can upload tweets, similar to YouTube's community posts. Tweets can be liked and commented on by other users.
- **Search Functionality:** Search videos based on keywords and tags using MongoDB's *$text* and *$regex* operators.
- **API Documentation:** Comprehensive API testing with a Postman collection available for easy testing.

This project follows industry-standard practices, ensuring code quality and maintainability.
## Tech Stack

- **Node.js & Express.js:** For building the RESTful API.

- **MongoDB & Mongoose:** As the database and ORM, providing schema-based data modeling and aggregation.

- **JWT & Bcrypt:** For secure authentication and password encryption.

- **Multer & Cloudinary:** For handling file uploads, such as video files and thumbnails.

- **Standard Practices:** Access tokens, refresh tokens, error handling, and secure routes for a professional-grade backend system.

- **Postman:** For API testing and documentation.
